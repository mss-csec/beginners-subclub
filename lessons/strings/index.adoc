= Strings

Goal: To understand how to initialize and manipulate text strings.

== Introduction

Individual variable types can be combined and be used as one unit. This
unit is known as a *container*. A string is a type of container as it is
a *chain of characters.* Words, and full sentences are examples of
strings. This lesson will focus on using the string container offered in
the `<string>` library.

In order to use standard strings from the string library, an *include
statement* must be made at the beginning of the C++ file. The string
library includes not only the container itself, but *member functions*
that are specifically for that container. Member functions can perform
many operations including string manipulation. A detailed list of the
string library can be found
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/[here].

== Variable Initialization and Input

Once the string library has been included, a string can be initialized
like any other variable. When a string is initialized, *the string
itself will always start off empty*. Therefore, outputting the string
immediately after initializing will simply output an empty string (`""`)
and not garbage.

When `std::cin` from the `<iostream>` library is used to get a value for a
string, the console will only accept all characters until it reaches
whitespace. This means *`cin` cannot be used to store an input that is a
sentence with spaces*. If inputs are supposed to have spaces, another
function is used. `getline` is a function that is used to get an
entire line of input and store it into a string. It is formatted like
the following:

++++
{% highlight cpp %}
getline(cin, variableName);
{% endhighlight %}
++++

**Example Code:**
++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    string name;       // initializes string
    cout << "What's your name?" << endl;
    getline(cin,name); // stores full name
    cout << "Hi " << name << ”!”;
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

**Sample Run:**
....
>>> What’s your name?
Herp da Derp
>>> Hi Herp da Derp!
....

NOTE: If `cin` was used before `getline`, `cin.ignore()` should be placed
before `getline()`. `cin.ignore()` is a function that clears any inputs
that are not stored in a variable and is required for `getline()` to work
properly.

== Using Member Functions and String Manipulation

As for all libraries for C++, a list of all member functions can be
found online. For a string, every function is made to manipulate/extract
information from a string. Therefore, most of the functions in the
string are formatted as follows:

++++
{% highlight cpp %}
stringName.memberFunction(parameters) // notice the dot
{% endhighlight %}
++++

For example, to find the length of a string, `strName.length()` will
return an integer that represents the length of the string with the
name, strName.

A string can be assigned text surrounded by quotation marks with an
equal sign (`=`).

String concatenation is the appending of two or more strings. Strings
can be added with text or other strings using the `+` operator. Since the
`+` operator can be used, the `+=` operator can be used as well.

**Example Code**
++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;
int main() {
    string str1 = "abc", str2 = "efg", str3; // initialized 3 strings
    cout << "str3 is " << str3.length() << " characters long." << endl;
    str3 = str2;          // assigns a value to str3
    cout << "str3 is " << str3.length() << " characters long." << endl;
    str3 += "d" + str1;     // concatenates str3 with "d" and str1
    cout << "str3 is " << str3.length() << " characters long." << endl;
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

**Output:**
....
str3 is 0 characters long.
str3 is 3 characters long.
str3 is 7 characters long.
....

The plus symbol (`+`) is the only arithmetic operator that can be used
with a string. *Do not try and subtract strings using the `-` operator.*
Likewise, `=` and `+=` are the only assignment operators that can be used
for strings.

NOTE: Do not add two string literals (text surrounded by quotation
marks) together.

++++
{% highlight cpp %}
str += "abc" + "def"; // "abc" can’t add with "def"
{% endhighlight %}
++++

The above code will result in an error because the computer is trying to
add two string literals. This could be fixed by altering the code like:

++++
{% highlight cpp %}
|str = (str + "abc") + "def"; // str adds with "abc", then with "def"
{% endhighlight %}
++++

That way, a *string will always add with a string literal* and *two
string literals will never add with each other.* The reason why strings
are able to add with string literals are beyond the scope of this
course. Just make sure to not add string literals together.

== Character Manipulation

Since a string is simply a sequence of characters, each character acts
as its own variable and *can be accessed and manipulated individually.*
Accessing a specific character in a string is formatted as follows,
`str[n]` where the character returned will be the ``n``th character in the
string.

Each character in a string has an *index*. All the characters in a
string are numbered in order *starting with index 0*. For example,
`str[1]` will give the second character in a string. Indexes are typically
used with for loops in order to access every character in a string.

NOTE: Be Careful! `str.length()` returns the length of a string, but the
highest index in that string will always be one less than the length of
the string.

++++
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
// This code outputs the reverse of a word
using namespace std;
int main() {
    string str;             // initializes string
    cin >> str;             // gets input (no sentences)
    string reverseStr;      // string to store the reverse of str
    // i is initialized as the highest index of str
    for (int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) { // index decreases by 1 each loop
        // in this context, i acts as an index number
        reverseStr += str[i]; // string is made by repeated concatenation
    }
    cout << str << " backwards is " << reverseStr; // outputs reverse str
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
++++

**Sample Run:**
....
Kappa
>>> Kappa backwards is appaK
....

== ASCII

ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
ASCII ensures that *every character is paired with a numerical value*.
Each character in a string is stored as that numerical value and every
character can be referred to be either the character itself, or its
numerical representation.

ASCII is further explained in link:/lessons/beginners/if-structures/[Chapter 7.]
