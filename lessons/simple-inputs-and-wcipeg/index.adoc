= Simple Inputs and Markville Online Judge

So far, the console was only told to output hardcoded values onto the
screen. Other than outputting values, the console is also able to accept
any inputs that are given by users.

The library <iostream> not only has `cout`, a command that outputs
values, but it also includes `cin`, a command that accepts inputs. `cin`
stands for **C**onsole **IN**put and its syntax is formatted as
follows.

[source]
cin >> variableName;

The `cin` command uses `>>` in its format while cout uses of `<<`. To
differentiate them, imagine the symbols as lines moving inwards (`>>`) or
moving outwards (`<<`). `cin` will tell the console to put all inputs into a
*specified variable*. Values cannot go into a `cin` command. Like `cout`,
each `cin` command can accept multiple inputs by separating each variable
name with `>>`.

.Example Code:
[source,role="linenos"]
----
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// This code takes two numbers and returns their sum
int main() {
    int num, num2;                       // initializes variables
    cout << "Pick 2 numbers!" << endl;   // displays message
    cin >> num >> num2;                  // receives input
    // the first input is placed in num and the second is placed in num2
    cout << "The Sum is " << num + num2; // outputs the sum
    return 0;                            // returns 0
}
----

.Sample run:
....
>>> Pick 2 numbers!
3
87
>>> The Sum is 90
....

== M3C/MOJ

http://m3cjudge.tk/[Markville Coding Online Judge] is a website that has
problems from past contests as well as problems from other sources for
students to practice coding. It also features an automated judge that will
test any submitted code against its problems. Users could submit their code
to be tested by the judge. This website also has live coding contests to
allow users to practice for the CCC in February.

Only registered users are able to use the online judge on the site. To
register, click the *_register_* button in the top right corner. To join the
Markville Secodnary School Organization on M3C, go to your profile
and change the organization to *_Markville Secondary School CS_*. *:))*

== Submitting Code

The problems page will display a list of all problems that the online
judge can test. The points represent the general difficulty of that
problem. (The easier problems are worth less
points)

* Each problem will ask for a specific output given a specific input. The
details and examples of the problem are located on the contest problem
page.
* On the contest problem page, the *Submit* link will be located on the
right side.
* Copy and paste the entire code or upload the code file into the
submission page
* Ensure that the language chosen in the drop-down menu is *{cpp} 03 (g{pp}
4.1.3)*
* Pray that the code works and outputs all intended values.
This document, from now on, will mostly use contest questions found on
these sites for its practice questions. Expect that the contest
questions found in the CCC to be of similar nature to the questions on
these sites.

== In Summary

* `cin` is a command found in the `<iostream>` library that takes a user input
and stores it into a variable.
* M3C is a site made for students to practice contest-styled
coding problems
